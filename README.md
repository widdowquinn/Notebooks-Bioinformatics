## Introduction

This repository contains Jupyter/iPython notebooks related to bioinformatics. Some of the notebooks are standalone examples/illustrations of concepts or code. Others are exercises or worksheets used in teaching, or for training courses.

All notebooks are stored with blank output cells.

Supporting information/data should always be available in subdirectories of this repository.
